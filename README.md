A README file provides the introduction of a project and explains it in brief so that a person who opens it gets an easier way of understanding the project.
README files are in many formats like md, txt, etc. The most common nowadays is the README.md ( Markdown) file which is used in this project as well.
Myscript is a script that is used to incorporate mismatches into a sequence and perform a blast.
This myscript file is saved with the extension .sh which makes it myscript.sh .
Once the mycript is saved and executed well, the next step is to add the myscript to the README.md file so that it can be added in the repo.
The script we use is the UNIX shell script.
This shell script is basically a command line interpreter.
It is used as it Manages the data, Processes the data and give simple results by carrying out simple calculations.
The git command has 4 basic further commands: 1) git clone : Cloning of README.md file is done by using "git clone" command. 2) git add : used to add the script to README.md 3) git commit : used to add the myscript to the repo 4) git push : used to push all the saved file to the repo using the github username and password so that under the master branch everything gets updated.
